OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
PROJECT NAME:WHEATHER APP
OBJECTIVE:To provide users with real-time and accurate weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.) based on their current location or a searched location.
To help users plan their daily activities and make informed decisions by offering forecasts, alerts, and updates about upcoming weather conditions.
TECHNOLOGIES USEDFrontend
HTML → To structure the content of the app.
CSS → To style and design the interface (responsive & attractive UI).
JavaScript → To add interactivity, fetch data from APIs, and dynamically update the UI.
(Optional) Frontend Frameworks/Libraries → React.js, Angular, or Vue.js for building modern and scalable apps.
Backend (if needed)
Node.js / Express.js → To create a server for handling requests (optional if directly using APIs in frontend).
Database (MongoDB, MySQL, Firebase) → If storing user preferences or past searches.
APIs
Weather API → OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, or AccuWeather to fetch real-time weather data.
CONCLUSION:The weather app provides users with real-time and accurate weather updates based on their location or a searched city. By integrating a weather API with a simple and user-friendly interface, the app makes it convenient to access essential information such as temperature, humidity, and conditions. This project demonstrates the effective use of web technologies to build practical applications that improve everyday life.
